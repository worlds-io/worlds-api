A geofence is a user-defined region in world coordinates. When a
[detection]({{Types.detection}}) occurs within a geofence, or a
[track]({{Types.track}}) crosses the border of a geofence, a [geofence
event]({{Types.geofenceevent}}) is created. Geofence events, along
with [zone events]({{Types.zoneevent}}) are a key part of creating
custom business logic with Worlds.
